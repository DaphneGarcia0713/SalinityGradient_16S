# How does salt influence microbial communitites?

# Question 1: how is microbial biodiversity modified across a salinity gradient?
          - Null hypothesis: microbial biodiversity (richness) does not vary along a salinity gradient 
	  - Hypothesis: microbial richness will increase with lower salt concentrations
		- there's an inverse relationship between richness and salinity
# Question 2: how does microbial composition change across a salinity gradient?
          - Null hypothesis: Microbial composition does not change across a salinity gradient
	  - Hypothesis: dominant members of the microbial community are unique in freshwater compared to salt water
		- have different dominant species
